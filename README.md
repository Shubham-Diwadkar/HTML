This repository is created to show you how the HTML and CSS can basically can create a basic webpage for you!


## StudentDetails (HTML)
This is a HTML file which shows only the elements and components on the webpage as we code line by line.
In this .html file I have used some famous tags which are as follows:

1.	Center: The `<center>` tag is an HTML element that was used in older versions of HTML to horizontally center the content within its container. However, it is no longer recommended to use the `<center>` tag as it is deprecated in HTML5. Instead, CSS should be used to control the layout and alignment of elements.
2.	Form: The `<form>` tag is an HTML element used to create a form on a web page. It is a container for various form controls and allows users to input data that can be submitted to a server for processing. The <form> element defines a form and contains other elements such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and more.
3.	Label: The `<label>` tag is an HTML element used to associate a text label with a form element, such as an input field. It provides a descriptive label that helps users understand the purpose or expected input for a form control. The `<label>` tag improves accessibility by allowing users to click on the label text to focus or activate the associated form control.
4.  Input: Input tags are HTML elements used to create various types of form controls or input fields where users can enter data. The `<input>` tag is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag. Instead, it uses attributes to define its behavior and appearance. There are various types in Input tags which are as follows:
  
    a)  Text Input: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="Enter your username">`
  
    b)  Password Input: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="password" name="password" id="password" placeholder="Enter your password">`
  
    c)  Checkbox: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="checkbox" name="agree" id="agree">`
  
    d)  Radio Buttons: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" id="male">`
    
    e)  Submit Button: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="submit" value="Submit">`  
  
5.  Select and Options: The `<select>` tag is an HTML element used to create a dropdown list or a select menu. It allows users to choose an option from a predefined list of options. The `<select>` element is typically paired with `<option>` elements to define the available choices within the dropdown list.
