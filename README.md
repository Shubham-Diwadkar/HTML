## StudentDetails (HTML)
This is a HTML file which shows only the elements and components on the webpage as we code line by line.
In this .html file I have used some famous tags which are as follows:

1.	Center: The `<center>` tag is an HTML element that was used in older versions of HTML to horizontally center the content within its container. However, it is no longer recommended to use the `<center>` tag as it is deprecated in HTML5. Instead, CSS should be used to control the layout and alignment of elements.
2.	Form: The `<form>` tag is an HTML element used to create a form on a web page. It is a container for various form controls and allows users to input data that can be submitted to a server for processing. The <form> element defines a form and contains other elements such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and more.
3.	Label: The `<label>` tag is an HTML element used to associate a text label with a form element, such as an input field. It provides a descriptive label that helps users understand the purpose or expected input for a form control. The `<label>` tag improves accessibility by allowing users to click on the label text to focus or activate the associated form control.
