# HTML-CSS
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
HTML consists of a series of elements.
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

This repository is created to show you how the HTML and CSS can basically can create a basic webpage for you!


## StudentDetails (HTML).html File
This is a HTML file which shows only the elements and components on the webpage as we code line by line.
In this .html file I have used some famous tags which are as follows:

1.	Center: The `<center>` tag is an HTML element that was used in older versions of HTML to horizontally center the content within its container. However, it is no longer recommended to use the `<center>` tag as it is deprecated in HTML5. Instead, CSS should be used to control the layout and alignment of elements.
2.	Form: The `<form>` tag is an HTML element used to create a form on a web page. It is a container for various form controls and allows users to input data that can be submitted to a server for processing. The <form> element defines a form and contains other elements such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and more.
3.	Label: The `<label>` tag is an HTML element used to associate a text label with a form element, such as an input field. It provides a descriptive label that helps users understand the purpose or expected input for a form control. The `<label>` tag improves accessibility by allowing users to click on the label text to focus or activate the associated form control.
4.  Input: Input tags are HTML elements used to create various types of form controls or input fields where users can enter data. The `<input>` tag is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag. Instead, it uses attributes to define its behavior and appearance. There are various types in Input tags which are as follows:
  
    a)  Text Input: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="Enter your username">`
  
    b)  Password Input: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="password" name="password" id="password" placeholder="Enter your password">`
  
    c)  Checkbox: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="checkbox" name="agree" id="agree">`
  
    d)  Radio Buttons: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" id="male">`
    
    e)  Submit Button: The syntax is
    
      `<input type="submit" value="Submit">`  
  
5.  Select and Options: The `<select>` tag is an HTML element used to create a dropdown list or a select menu. It allows users to choose an option from a predefined list of options. The `<select>` element is typically paired with `<option>` elements to define the available choices within the dropdown list.

## Contact Form (HTML and CSS).html File
This is a HTML file which shows not only the elements and components on the webpage but also gives it a stylish look. In this .html file I have used some famous tags which are as follows:

1.  Header3: The HTML `<h3>` tag is used to define a third-level heading in a document. It represents a section heading that has a lower level of importance compared to `<h1>` and `<h2>`, but higher than subsequent heading levels.
2.  Division: The `<div>` tag is an HTML element used as a container or a division within an HTML document. It does not have any inherent meaning or semantic value, but it is commonly used to group and style other elements or sections of content.
3.  Form: The `<form>` tag is an HTML element used to create a form on a web page. It is a container for various form controls and allows users to input data that can be submitted to a server for processing. The <form> element defines a form and contains other elements such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and more.
  a)  Action: A `<form>` tag with an action attribute specifies the URL or endpoint to which the form data will be submitted when the user submits the form. The syntax is
  
      `<form action="/submit-form" method="POST"></form>`
  
4.  Style: The `<style>` tag is an HTML element used to define inline CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) within an HTML document. It allows you to apply specific styles to individual elements or groups of elements without the need for an external CSS file. The `<style>` tag is placed within the `<head>` section of the HTML document. CSS rules and declarations are written inside the `<style>` tag. In this case, we have defined styles for the `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`, etc.

After Submit button is clicked it will redirect to the specifed webpage the form is told to go which is done using action attribute in the form tag.

[NOTE: In my case I am redirecting it to Students Details (HTML).html file]
