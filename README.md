# JavaScript

JavaScript is a popular programming language that is primarily used for web development.
It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich and has since become one of the fundamental technologies for building interactive web applications.

## Features
1. Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is mainly executed on the client-side, meaning it runs in the user's web browser. This allows for dynamic and interactive web pages.
2. Object-Oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms, allowing developers to create reusable code and organize their projects efficiently.
3. Versatility: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks beyond web development, including server-side scripting, desktop application development, and even mobile app development (using frameworks like React Native or Ionic).
4. Event-driven Programming: JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it responds to events such as user actions (clicks, mouse movements) or changes in the web page's state. This makes it well-suited for creating interactive user interfaces.
5. Large Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem with numerous libraries and frameworks available, making it easier for developers to build complex applications efficiently. Some popular frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js.

## Usage
To use JavaScript in your web page, you can include the JavaScript code directly in an HTML file using <script> tags, or you can link an external JavaScript file. 

### Factorial.html File

This is a simple web page that calculates the factorial of a number using JavaScript.
When executed in a web browser, it prompts the user to enter a number and then displays the factorial of that number on the page.

- Open the `Factorial.html` file in a web browser.
- The web page will prompt you to enter a number.
- Enter a positive integer and press "OK."
- The factorial of the entered number will be displayed on the web page.
